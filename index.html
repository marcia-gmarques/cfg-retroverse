        <h2>A Virtual Reality experience that takes you through the grief of losing 
            a loved one and immerses you in the nostalgia of iconic video games like 
            Tetris, Super Mario, and Pac-Man.</h2>
        <p>The Retroverse team has been working on this project for three months as 
            part of their MSc in Interactive Digital Media. It all started with an idea 
            to create something that is unique, that no one else thought it would be 
            possible given the three month time frame. We wanted to bring together all 
            the things we learnt throughout our course and use it for this project. </p>

        <p> Doing a virtual reality project challenged us creatively and academically; 
            from generating ideas, 3D designing the rooms, to programming the game mechanics. 
            Before completing this project, none of the Retroverse team members were familiar 
            with Unity or C#, which are the software and coding language used. Having started 
            out as com- plete virtual reality beginners, we are exceptionally proud to present 
            to you our final project. Everything that you experience in the Retroverse is 
            built from scratch; the 3D models, game narrative, and functionality that has been 
            coded line by line. </p>
        <p> If you are interested in how we built Lost in the Retroverse, 
            all our progress is documented and available to watch on our social media accounts: </p>
